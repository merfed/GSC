As the tile says I'm working on a WMO editor, It is still in the development progress but as one of the most requested features is already finished: Adding M2-models to the doodad sets. Though everything is quite experimental and sometimes unstable. Also certain user interface things might be useless or unintuitive but thats because its still under development.

Viewing works from 1.0 to 5.2, editing is tested for 3.3.5 but should work from 1.0 to 5.2 as well.

## How to use

1. Open the editor, it loads from the path in the registry and opens up a default WMO
2. Go to WMO List and select the WMO you'd like to edit (double click)
3. Explore, hide groups or switch between doodad sets
4. Enter a path to a m2-model in the box (you can press the ... button and a window pops up with all models (may take a few seconds to load, its not yet finished) and when you double click on a model its pasted in the box.
5. Select the doodad set (bottom list box) where you'd like to add the m2-model
6. Press Place and move the mouse to the spot where the model should be place.
7. Use the keys x, y, c to rotate along the axis (+ shift to rotate in the other direction) and numpad + or numpad - to scale the model.
8. Press the left mouse button to place the model or the middle mouse button to discard the current model
9. File -> Save and you are good to go
