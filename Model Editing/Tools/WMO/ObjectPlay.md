- **AKA**: Object Spawner

_Object Playground Object Spawning Addon_

Me and a few friends have been using this addon for a while to rapidly spawn gameobject on private servers. The point of this addon is to be able to spawn game object with ease and without the need to a million macros.

Type "`/op mover`" in Game - All the features can be used from the interface but if you would like you may also keybind them. 

The Object W,L,H will need to be adjusted for each new object you put in or the type of project you are doing.

# Features

## Keybindings

- **Get Gameobject Id**: Grabs the id of the nearest gameobject and saves it for spawning.
- **Single Spawn**: Spawns the game object you have entered or saved Spawn game object that you have entered or grabbed
- **Single Spawn W/O Port**: Spawns the game object you have entered or saved but does it without porting first.
- **Custom Move**: Allows you to move in multiple directions at once.
- **Spawn Toggle**: Toggles spawning game object when you move. Usefull for when you want to move a space but not spawn an object.

## Other

- **Save Spawns**: Allows you to control if you want your spawns saved or not.
