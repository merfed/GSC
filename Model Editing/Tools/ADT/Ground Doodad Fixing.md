Fixes ground doodad display on an ADT.

The program will generate a new file named the same as the input ADT but with the suffix "`_new`" so the original file isn't overwritten. Most likely you will be using this tool after you use the Ground Effects tool.

# Usage

Drop a single ADT onto the program, or make a batch file for processing multiple files.

# Version

- The source included with *version 2* of **GEFixer** is the same source as the *4-14-12* version.
