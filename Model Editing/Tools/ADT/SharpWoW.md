# From Cromon's Announcement Thread

After a long struggle on YiasDX with unstable and improper code i decided two weeks ago that i will start all over again with a clean and well organized base of code which will allow a better and more flexible way of extensibility in the future. And besides that the new product aims to provide you an All-In-One solution for all your needs. You no longer need to use a dozen of programs to change all that you wanna change like DBC files, terrain files or light parameters you do that all in the same application with editors specialized for that specific task.  
  
During the last two weekends a lot of code already evolved (around 3500 lines) and the most basic features are now implemented. Of course a lot of things that are implemented are though still WIP and not finished (like captions in windows, placements of menus, ...). With this post id like to give you a first preview of the features and the possibility to intervene if you think something is going in a wrong direction (or of course confirmation if its what you absolutely wanna have ![](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/images/smilies/wink.png "Wink")).
