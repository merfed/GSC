# From Cromon's Announcement Thread

I present you my newest creation. YiasEdit DX. Its a completly new version of my old WoW Mapeditor. It has changed so much that it basically isnt the same program anymore. A lot of more details were added, a lot of more features came into place and it is now a lot more userfriendly!  
  
After several weeks of developping a first beta is ready to get shipped. Its purposes are to test the very basic features and basically to test the core engine. Its important to have a good base before i continue to program on the fancy features (which actually are already ready ;)). So for me its very important that you post errors you get so i can improve and strenghten the engine. If this works fine during the next week ill add more features (it has very less feautures atm) and will give you new versions.  
  
During the night and tomorrow i will write and upload a complete documentation about the current features aswell as a filled tutorialsystem (which atm has only 3 entries).  
  
I hope you will enjoy it and post a lot of things.
