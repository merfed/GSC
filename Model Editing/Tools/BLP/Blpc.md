# Requirements

Requires Microsofts .Net Framework 4.0, Windows Installer 3.1 and Libsquish (included).

# Known Issues

- This is not Photoshop. Converting huge textures (e.g. 2048x2048) can take some time depending on your texture type. Textures of more common dimensions should be converted almost instantly though.
- Jpeg encoded Blp textures NYI. Tell me if you find an example within the WoW data files.

# Using cBlp2 in your projects

Handling blp files with the Blp2 class is quite simple:

```c#
using MDS.cBlp2;
using System.Drawing;

...

Blp2 myBlp = Blp2.FromFile(@"C:\test.blp");
Bitmap myBmp = (Bitmap)myBlp;
// Do stuff


myBlp = Blp2.FromFile(@"C:\test.png");
myBlp.Save(@"C:\test.blp", LibSquish.DxtFormat.Dxt3, Blp2.ResizeMethod.Extend, true);
myBlp.Save(@"C:\test2.jpeg", System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg);
```

For more information rummage through the hopefully well documented Blp2 class or take a look at the implementation in Blpc.
