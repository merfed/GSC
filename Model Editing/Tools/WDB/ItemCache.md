# Installation

1. Create the folder "dump" in the root (if not exists) then give it chmod 777.
2. Open "config.php" in Notepad and configure the fields you feel like changing.

# Todo

1. Fix tooltips on search results.
2. Create own design, preferably smaller...
3. Add more functions, clean up unessesary code from Wowhead sources!
4. Implement the modelviewer feature onto item pages.
5. Support to search XML database in case Wowhead is offline, and return 404 if there are no matches at all from the XML database.
6. Share network between the sites, with a syncronization page so the servers won't be overloaded.
