I was asked to help with the creation of Gilneas for Wrath of the Lich King for a project RP, these are the maps that I supplied them. I suppose it still somehow modifies his own image, however, Here I download all my version. The first map contains alpha version battlegrounds Battle for Gilneas, which took place at the Gilneas and no special map as it is today, and the second map is a standard Gilneas. Patch for WoW 3.3.5a (but will certainly work around 3.xx) that must modified WoW.exe because it contains Fast Login Screen. The coordinates for the maps are:

The first version of `X -1753 Y 1373 Z 20 MapID 13`
Druh√° verze X `-1753 Y 1373 Z 20 Folders 451`
