During Cata in one PTR, Blizzard accidentally released some development maps. They pulled the plug before the maps were fully transferred, so what we got was a jumbled mess of floating objects, empty untextured adts, and crashy areas. Even then, they give a really good insight into how Blizzard builds some areas, as well as some experiments they made.

I did my best to recover the most complete and interesting areas and port them to 3.3.5.

To use it, simply put it in your `<Wow folder>/data` directory.

Here are some .go commands so you can get there:

.go 4667.49 -334.099 270.971 605 - Developer village (The area with windmills made out of a lighthouse, a westfall windmill and a barrel.
.go -5430.23 -11138.7 17.6441 605 - Developer island (The little island with huts and palm trees, in a sea without water bordering a big objectless landmass.
.go -10239.1 -7729.27 292.596 605- Developer Wotlk test (An area dedicated to testing Northrend human buildings and Vrykul buildings, it appears to be a cliff that is part of Howling Fjord, it has building names written in the ground)
.go 9296.79 -9987.97 42.1634 605 - Developer Sholazar test (Like Designer Island, this seems like it's a place to test a whole variety of objects, it's a piece of Sholazar basin with all objects wiped and new stuff replacing them.)
.go -4698 1458 -42 605 - Proto Azjol Nerub (An early incarnation of Azjol Nerub that could be the iteration they planned when Azjol Nerub was meant to be a zone and not two instances.)

**Edit**: Third coordinate is wrong, correctly is .go -10277 -7616 300 605
