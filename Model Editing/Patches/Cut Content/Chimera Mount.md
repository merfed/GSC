```
This mount was added in build 18164 but totally removed from the game files a few builds later.
This model was supposed to be an iconic mob of Draenor, but for unknown reasons it was scrapped. You can still find its skull in the Legion login screen and all around Draenor, specially Gorgrond.

It was requested many times, so here it goes.
It's in WoD file format, to use it in Wotlk you must retro-port it.
