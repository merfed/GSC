# Process

My way of working

Well first I start off with a design. This can either be a small sketch in my sketch book or a more worked out drawing. It doesn’t really matter so much for me, because I often have a perfect image of the model in my head.

After that I start modelling. I use maya 8, because after using it for a year it works a lot better for me then working with 3ds max (which I have 3 years of experience with). I always box model and barely use primitives. I also try to keep an overall low poly count and my geometry is always nice and clean. I did notice that there still some shading errors in my models when converted for WoW , but I think that’s because there to complicated here and there.

After the model is done I start doing the UV’s. I do this by hand using the UV tools provided in the maya software package. I try to use my texture space as good as possible (giving more important parts more space and such). I always use a reference map on the model while texturing to look for seams and distortion.

After that is done I save my UV layout and start hand painting the texture in Photoshop. After the base is done I might add some dirt textures to give it more “randomness”.

When that’s done I triangulate the model and exported it to an .obj file. Then import in to 3ds max, alter the size and position (also make textures 2-sided if necessary) and export it as an 3ds file. I still do it this way because the maya m2 converter I found needs to be compiled and I have no idea how to do that >.<. 

After that it’s converting the PNG textures to BLP textures and converting the .3ds file to an m2 format. I do this with the converters found in glitches thread about custom models on mmowned. 

Then I load the m2 file into the M2modder for texture blend adjustments. And when that’s done I use glitchys model finder to find the correct Treepaths to weapons I want to replace. And then of course build a patch using Mywarcraftstudios to make it work.

I always first get the size and position right using WoWmodelviewer and when that’s how I want it I try it out in game. If the model happen to be black, white or green I go look at my check list for errors and usually after I done that things work (error checklist mostly consists of: is texture to big, I the texture name properly linked to the model and did I forget to triangulate before exporting from maya).

So yah my process of creating a model is just like others, only I am more focused on the model itself. Because like I said before I really don’t know anything yet about World editing or hex editing, But when it comes to properly building models I do an alright job ;D.

Well hope this gives you some inside on what I do and can, I also attached a Photoshop file with some screenshots of how I created the handle of the sword ☺.
