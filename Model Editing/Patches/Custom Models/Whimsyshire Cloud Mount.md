I made this model to test how different materials and particles interacted with each other. The result was not optimal and I couldn't add all the effects I wanted due to WoW's old rendering engine. Instead of deleting it I decided to release it because it's playable, nonetheless (despite of some renderflag bugs).

For 3.3.5a. Includes icons and 4 skin variations.

Â¿How can I make my character sit while mounted?
-Spell.dbc column 132 -> SpellVisual.dbc column 5 -> SpellVisualKit.dbc column 3 = animation played (97 = SitGround).
