Well, when I used to do the project - Custom Expansion.
It was called "Wargate".
Planned to create six locations, removing the rest of the world (Azeroth, Kalimdor, Northrend and Outland). Level cap was 50 lvl.
Over time I understood it was too hard task and refused the project.
-------
Just like after any other project I still have a model, texture, location and etc
I decided to give some of them public.
I hope they will be useful, as they could when it is useful to me:\
