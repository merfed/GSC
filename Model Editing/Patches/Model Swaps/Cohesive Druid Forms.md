# Original Readme

```
INSTALLATION:
Remove the "ALLCAPS-" prefix from the patch-3.MPQ file. Put patch-3.MPQ in game "data" folder. Tested on Kronos and Nostalrius private servers. Note: only usable on classic private servers using 1.12.1 WoW game client.

Download All-Purpose Patch
Download All-Purpose Patch (for 'Nostalrius' private server)

Note: Nostalrius uses the wrong mob ID for Travel Form, that's why there are two patch versions here.
This "All-Purpose" patch uses the Stag Travel Form and faction-neutral colors for both Travel and Aquatic Forms. See Below for other patch options...

--------------

Alternative Patches:

Color options for Travel and Aquatic Forms: Neutral / Horde / Alliance
Model options for Travel Form: Stag / Storm Crow

Understand that the patch you choose will determine the appearance of Travel/Aquatic Form for BOTH Horde and Alliance Druids, e.g. if you choose an "Alliance" patch then Travel/Aquatic Forms will be the purple-ish long-eared variety for Alliance and Horde Druids alike.
hint: Look at the MPQ files' "PREFIX-" to figure out which patch is which. "Default" contains the new Legion SeaLion model.
