This guide will show you how to do basic vertex manipulation to .wmo objects.. Getting to Old Ironforge will be used as an example..  .

Almighty, how this is all going to work is kinda self explanatory, so I wont drag it on this time.  Just go into MyWoWStudio and get the Ironforge_090.wmo file extracted as explained in the previous OldIF guide.  If your wondering how I knew Ironforge_090.wmo was my exact target, please the 1st few parts of the previous guide.

Since version 0.1.9 or so I fixed a rotation bug, but this in turn can kinda screw us up here because if you open the target .WMO file, you wont initially see this to the right.  In 0.2.0 you'll see a little thing that wont take up much space. So first **check the Keep object in view checkbox**, and then hit A a few times to rotate.  You should only need to hit A about 15 to 25 times to get in it view with that checkbox checked...

Then just rotate it around so you can see from a side view.  Then select the floor area / bottom half, but NOT the tunnel that leads down.  Then from the options menu, choose to shift the Z axis, and shit it DOWN by 8 (so input the NEGATIVE number -8 )   
  
And then just save, repack into a MPQ< and your done!  See [the video as to how to use it (you need to jump right)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66m4EVGBwn4).
