Ok yall, heres my latest guide. This guide explains how the XYZ and ABC axis works, just a quick over view to help better explain it  
  
Review of the XYZ axis:  
  
The World of Warcraft XYZ axis looks like this in simple (barewith, made this in paint)

As apposed to the more common XYZ axises of other things:

This better helps you see the axises that we will be refeering to in this guide.  
  
Now heres some baic info supplied by Muster  
Ok i have opened a crypt in my WMO editor.This is the room at the bottom of the crypt where the Undead start.

Now this is what happens when i raise the X axis by 10 on half of the room

Now this is what happens when the Y axis is raised by 10 on half of the room

Now here is a side view of the room

Now this is what happens if i raise half of the rooms Z axis by 10

Hope you all understand a little more about the XYZ axis now
  
  
Now that we have a better understanding of the xyz axis, lets go to the abc axis, better known as the axises of rotation.  
  
There is 3 different forms of rotation, as there is 3 axises, the A B and C axises. Heres how eachone works,(sorry, its hard to rotate with a laptop mouse)  
  
The A axis works similar to how a person does a flip, flipping the top with the bottom, going either forward or backward

The B axis, is the most commonly used axises of rotation. The reason is the A and C axis effect whether or not the object is standing up properly, where as the B axis only alters which direction it is facing. The B axis is like when you turn from left to right, changing which way you are facing.

The C axis, is similar to the A axis, but it is like how a person does a cartweel, keeping the same portion facing forward, but still spinning

There is other things that relate to a .wmo, such as flags. The simplest of an explination i can explain, is how in a .wmo u can go through one part, like a lamp, but not through a wall. Flags apply different settings, but need to have further research.
