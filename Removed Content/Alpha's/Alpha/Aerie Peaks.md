**Aerie Peaks**, or **Aerie Peak**, was the original name given to the [[Hinterlands]] region during the development of World of Warcraft.[^1] The plural name has been referenced multiple times through older sources before the launch of World of Warcraft. The name Aerie Peak now refers to the capital of the Wildhammer clan rather than the entirety of the Hinterlands. [^2]

# Mentions

- In Day of the Dragon, it was described as a foreboding, mountainous region beyond even the elven realm of Quel'Thalas, where the skilled dwarves of Aerie Peaks lived and rode wild gryphons.[^3]
- The Warcraft III manual described the Wildhammer gryphon riders as having brought the mighty gryphons of the Aerie Peaks to aid the Alliance in its time of need.[^4]
- The non-canonical Alliance & Horde Compendium RPG book described the home of the Wildhammers as "the cold, high peaks of Lordaeron" and "the high mountain home in the Aerie Peak region of Lordaeron".[^5]
