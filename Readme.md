Welcome to the WoW Coffee/Exploration/Emulation archive.

This does not include any actual programs, patches or anything of the sort. This is all for guides and tutorials, tool documentation, and so forth.

For patches and tools see: [Coffee](https://github.com/merfed/Coffee/). The coffee repo will eventually be replaced with something better as my archive is roughly 30 Gb in size.

# How to Use

1. Download and Install [Obsidian MD](https://obsidian.md/).
2. Clone or download this repo.
3. Run Obsidian, open an existing folder (the repo you cloned/downloaded) as a vault. Enjoy.
