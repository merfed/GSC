# Floating Island

During Alpha, a floating island could be found in the sky, above the sea near Teldrassil. It contained a waterall, a small orc camp with tents, similar too the ones in The Barrens. As well as a few decorative elements from Deadwind Pass.

It's believed this area was used for marketing materials.
