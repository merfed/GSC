**Gillijim's Isle** is located in [[Eastern Kingdoms]], right next to [[Island of Doctor Lapidis]] in the ocean of the coast of [[Stranglethorn Vale]]. Currently there is nothing located on the ADT where Gillijim's Isle was located, having only existed during WoW Alpha 0.5.3. The area ID existed from 1.0.0 to 3.3.5a, where it was removed upon the revamp of Azeroth for Cataclysm.

The island features much of the same structures and textures as the rest of Stranglethorn. Including troll ruins, a murloc settlement, bridges, and a river formed by M2's which are used in [[Elwynn Forest]] as waterfalls. The island is surrounded by beaches filled with skeletons of turtles and whales, and a small murloc pier, and shipwrecks in the water.

John Staats mentions that this island, along with the Island of Doctor Lapidis did not make it to the live version because Stranglethorn Vale was already packed with content.
