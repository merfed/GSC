**GM Island** is a small contested island in [[Kalimdor]] located northwest of [[Teldrassil]]. It's composed of 6 ADTs that form a square. GM Island is designed to serve as a _home_ for Game Masters.

The main building on the center of the the island did not exist anywhere else in the game until _Cataclysm_ (where it became the Command Center). The WMO used is called `GuildHouseA.wmo`, from the scrapped Guild Housing system.

- `gmdungeon.wmo` Was a large box filled with a grid of white textures, and a model of a chair called "_The Chair_" in the center. It was used prior to patch 1.3 for GMs to interact and talk with offenders.

# Graveyard

The graveyard is not keyed to any specific faction, so dying here will send you to a specific location for each faction. Horde will go to Crossroads, and Alliance to Sentinel Hill. According to `WorldSafeLocs.dbc` it has ID **589** and is set to coordinates `X: 16310.3 Y: 16268.9 Z: 69.4444`.

# Official Media

GM Island has appeared in official media on the European WoW website for GM recruitment, featuring a troll in the screenshot. The troll "Tuskfyre" and and gnome "Ari" are said to be amoung the residents of GM Island and are doing what they can to make sure that any technical problems in Azeroth are resolved.

When the new character models were released in Warlords of Draenor, a video titled [Lemmy the Gnome in "Gnomo-plasty"!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rmfd_kDsgqQ) was uploaded on the official World of Warcraft youtube account that featured a room similar to the prison, or using textures from it (`Ak_Gmgrid.BLP`), in addition other similar BLP and WMO files such as `TestDungeon.WMO` appear in the latest versions of WoW. In Warlords of Draenot, the minimap for `GMDungeon.wmo` also changed.
