**The Abyssal Maw** was a scrapped instance from Cataclysm. The unused entrance hallway is next to [[Throne of the Tides]]. Originally it was planned as a launch dungeon, it was pushed back to patch 4.2, to be released along side the [[Firelands]]. It was eventually scrapped completely to focus on the Firelands.

The fights would have taken place inside a thrid shelled demigod that had been corrupted by the naga. Ghostcrawler says that _"It was three bosses inside Nespirah, with no unique art."_ Though earlier previews described the dungeon as multiple raised underwater plateaus above a chasm. Initial reports suggested it was going to be a 5-man dungeon at launch, but may later have become a raid before getting scrapped.

Ghostcrawler, WoW's lead systems designer at the time talked about the Abyssal Maw during Blizzard's Cataclysm post-mortem blog series:

> I feel like I should mention Abyssal Maw again. As with many cancelled features, it somehow took on a life of its own in the minds of players. Believe me, though -- you just don't cancel things that you think are going to be awesome. It was three bosses inside Nespirah, with no unique art. The reason it was originally appealing to us was because we had so many Vashj'ir assets that we could use. But by the time it was time to do the work, we felt like we (and many players) had Vashj'ir fatigue. Now don't get me wrong -- I loved Vashj'ir. I was an oceanographer, remember? Vashj'ir delivered on the promise of an underwater zone, but we feel like most players were ready to be done with it by the time they had quested through that. (Individuals will feel differently -- it's that diverse player base thing again.) Firelands received a lot of new art, from bosses to environments, and we just didn't feel like Abyssal Maw was going to compete. Who knows, though! We haven't totally given up on the idea of cool underwater experiences, so maybe there's potential we'd visit it again someday. (For my money, the zone I am personally saddest about cancelling is not Abyssal Maw; it was the Azjol-Nerub quest zone in Wrath of the Lich King.)
