# Karazhan Crypts

Also known as the Deadwind Pass Crypt it lies behind the tower of Karazhan in the cemetery at Morgan's Plot.

There's been some speculation that it was an unfinished instance, a testing location as well as a playground for developers. It has also been incorrectly assumed to be the lower portion of karazhan, which is supposed to mirror the upper half, since the architecture is off, this is incorrect.

Not sure I know the story on it but knowing our development processes back then there tended to be a lot more stuff made that we just didn't use. I can't imagine the game rating rumor is accurate, because if it was content we wanted to use we'd just take out the upside-down sinners or whatever the issue was and use it for whatever it was we wanted to do with that space. It's not like they're permanent fixtures. Fun rumor though! :) More likely we just changed our minds.

On September 2018, John Staats answered a question about the intentions for the crypt in a Reddit AMA:

> Additional quest areas. I turned out we didn't need them so I never finished them. They're only half-baked play spaces. :P

## Subzones

### Well of the Forgotten

After entering the crypt and descending down the stairs you will enter a medium sized room with one open pathway. The pathway leads to Pauper's Walk. The only thing in this room is a large tomb, and a stone bench.

### Pauper's Walk

Pauper's walk is a winding hallway that either goes straight or branches off to the right, both sides lead to the crypt. Taking the path to the right has another path just before the crypt that branches off to the left. Following this down will take you to the lower part of the crypt.

### Crypt

This is right after you exit Pauper's walk, and contains a few smaller tombs with openable doors named `Doodad_WroughtIronDoor01-Doodad_WroughtIronDoor09` and `Doodad_opendoor_01-Doodad_opendoor_03`. `Doodad_WroughtIronDoor04` seems to be missing, and `Doodad_opendoor_02` is crushed under the terrain.

Moving between this part of the upper crypt will change your channel frequently between Deadwind Pass and Duskwood.

The lower part of the crypt leads to an area called Tome of the Unrepentant off to the back left. The top left of the lower part of the crypt leads to the an area called The Upside-down Sinners.

### Tome of the Unrepentant

The tome of the Unrepentant is a medium sized room that is entered via two hallways with 3 pits between them.

The lower area accessed via the pits along the hallways leads to a room that contains another pit allowing you into the lower tome of the unrepentant, a room to the right which is empty and finally a room to the left that has a staircase taking you to the Pit of Criminals.

### Pit of Criminals

A large empty room with a pool and a pile of bones.

### The Upside-down Sinners

This pool of water filled with chains suspending bodies from them leads to two different areas. One straight forward, and another directly below where you enter the pool and along the back wall.

The first room, directly across from where you enter is called the Slough of Despair, and it's just an empty pit.

The second room leads into the lower portion of Tome of the Unrepentant, and this can also be accessed via the pits along the hallways into the upper portion of the Tome of the Unrepentant. When entering this area, off to the left you can access the Pit of Criminals as well.

## Methods

### Auto-unstuck

**Confirmed working**: 3.3.5

Standing at ```39.8, 72.51``` facing the corner closest to you make sure your heartstone is deleted and use auto unstuck. You will clip through the wall. From here you can turn left a little and jump down into the crypt.

### Mount & Disconnect

**Confirmed working**: 6.0, 6.1, 6.2

Stand in the corner of the crypt in Morgan's Plot (```39.51, 72.49```). Mount up and use the disconnect macro. Logging back in you will be in the wall, from there you can edge yourself along the interior wall and fall into the crypt.

`/run for v=1,500 do for i = 1,GetNumFactions() do SetWatchedFactionIndex(i) end end`

This method is a slight variation on the "Mount & Noggenfogger Elixir" method, where you can use an Elixir of Giant Growth before mounting and the disconnect macro to make it easier to clip through the wall. Other differences here is that it's not limited to a drake mount, you can use mammoths and other medium sized mounts.

Alternatively there are reports of using ```alt``` + ```f4``` just before finishing casting the mount will allow you to clip through the walls. It's just a tad bit easier to use the disconnect macro, but should you have any issues this other option is available.

### Demonic Circle: Summon

**Confirmed working**: 6.2

**Requirements**
* Warlock
* Glyph of Eye of Kilrogg

Wedging yourself at the back right corner of the crypt in Morgan's Plot (```39.51, 72.49```) so that you're directly facing the back corner spam the Eye of Kilrogg until it clips through the wall. Once it clips through there is no need to move, just use Demonic Circle: Summon to place the Demonic Circle and then teleport in with Demonic Circle: Teleport.

Once you teleport in, move your characters view towards the stairs or floor past the gate, and step forward and you'll fall right into the crypt.

There may be some issues with getting the Eye of Kilrogg to clip through the wall. From what Muromuro has gathered the eye first tries to spawn in front of you, if that path is blocked it spawns behind you. If that is also blocked it ignores the terrain in front of you and spawns. The key is to just alter where you're looking opposite to where it's spawning.

### Mount & Noggenfogger Elixir

**Confirmed working**: 5.0.5, 5.1.0, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4.8

[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5yJ7NEdE0o)

**Requirements**
* Noggenfogger Elixir
* Drake Mount (Albino, Red, Bronze, etc)
* Speed Boost (Rocket Boots, Sprint, Goblin Racial etc)
* Slow Fall

Start off in the back right corner of the crypt in Morgan's Plot (```39.51, 72.49```). And drink the Noggenfogger Elixir until you get the small buff ("You feel smaller") and the skeleton buff ("You have stopped breathing"). Once you have both of those get as close as you can to the corner of the wall. And mount up with a drake mount. Once you have mounted tap space 1-3 times, once that is down turn on slow walk (```\```) and walk onto the ledge to your left. Staying inside the wall. You will look like you're floating on air. Here you can change the camera view until you can see into the crypt and position your character towards there. Get a slow fall buff,  and make sure you're back to running (hit the ```\``` key again) and use your speed boost to run forward. No need to jump, just run forward and you'll fall into the crypt.
