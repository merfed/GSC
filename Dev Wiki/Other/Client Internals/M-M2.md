## Highlight

You can use Highlight+ to highlight models that are selected. Max Highlight is 15.5 so upon selection use:

```
_MemoryWrite("0x" & hex($LightVarInput), $DllInformation, 15.5, 'float')
```

And upon deselection its turned back to the default 0.5

```
_MemoryWrite("0x" & hex($LightdwnVarInput), $DllInformation, 0.5, 'float')
```

0.0 turns the object dark.

## Render X,Y & Z

Render X, Y and Z defines the render position of the object. Normally if you just move the object and the camera leaves the original object position the object stops rendering. Moving Render X,Y and Z along with the object allows you to to extend the render eara to the intire ADT plane.

## UniqueID

The UniqueID is the same as the one stored in the ADT file. This allows you to get info about the object such as filename, MPQ location etc. If anyone was to make a ingame Model tool it would be quite handy to have all relevant MPQ data when selecting a object incase you want to change it. This also allows you to export changes directly into the ADT files after they have been edited ingame.

## Stretch_X

Stretch_X Y and Z seems to be the initiall rotation of a object but im not quite sure how it works. WoWInfinity's squeze function simply turns X and Y 0.00001 making all objects flat.
