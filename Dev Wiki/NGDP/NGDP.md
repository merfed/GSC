NGDP is an abbreviation for something along the likes of **N**ext **G**eneration [**D**istribution/**D**elivery/**D**ata] [**P**latform/**P**ipeline]. It uses [TACT](https://wowdev.wiki/TACT "TACT") for content transfer and [CASC](https://wowdev.wiki/CASC "CASC") for local content storage.

## History

NGDP was introduced to the public in early 2014 with the release of the Heroes of the Storm Technical Alpha. Blizzard then slowly moved its existing products over to NGDP over the following years. In World of Warcraft's Warlords of Draenor Alpha, it switched over to NGDP and its [CASC](https://wowdev.wiki/CASC "CASC") filesystem.
