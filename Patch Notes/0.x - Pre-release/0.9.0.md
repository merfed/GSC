# Major Changes

## Hunters

The Hunter Class is now available to test! Hunters track, tame, and slay all manner of animals and beasts found in the wild. Whether they rely on bows or firearms, Hunters consider their weapons and pets to be their only true friends. Races allowed to become Hunters are the Night Elf, Dwarf, Orc, Tauren, and Troll.

Hunters are great for pulling monsters as they are able to set traps that hinder monsters that the Hunters pull to attack. Hunters are also able to use various beast-related special abilities, take on bestial traits that give them supernatural powers, control and tame beasts, and use a wide variety of ranged attacks complimented by a few melee abilities.

Hunters are closely related to their pets and must remember to always keep their pet's happiness in mind. When using a pet, Hunters will notice an icon in the top left corner of their screen that depicts their pet's happiness. The more Hunters use their pets, the lower their pet's level of happiness will become. Hunters should always remember to feed their pets to raise their pet's level of happiness or worry about their pet abandoning them or even attacking the Hunter! Hunters are also the only class able to name their pets.

The Hunter can use the following weapons: Axes, Daggers, Guns or Bows, Crossbows (with training), Fist Weapons (with training), Spears (with training), Staves (with training), Swords, (with training), Thrown (with training), Two-Handed Axes (with training), Two-Handed Swords (with training). The Hunter can use the following armor: Cloth, Leather, Shields, and Mail (at level 40, with training).

## Boats and Zeppelins

Our first pass at Boats and Zeppelins has been added to the world in two locations. A boat has been added between Booty Bay and Ratchet, and a Zeppelin has been added between Orgrimmar and Tirisfal. A second zeppelin has also been added between Grom'gol and Orgrimmar. The round trip on all three of these new transports is around five minutes, with a pause at each destination of one minute each. If you miss a transport, you will have a very short wait before it returns. If you log out or crash during your journey, you will log back in on the same transport you were on when you logged out, although you will likely be at a different location along its path. Because this was the original intention for our world travel, the instant teleport NPCs have been removed. Please do not jump off of Boats and/or Zeppelins when riding them. Keep in mind that the Goblin Transit Authority is not responsible for accidents of this nature and you may land in a place where you cannot reach your corpse.

## Talent System

Talents are now available for the Priest and Rogue classes! Priest and Rogue players can now utilize the talent interface by using the "Talents" button, which resides next to the "Spellbook and Abilities" button, or by pressing the "N" default hotkey.

Talents for other classes will continue to be added as the beta progresses. Please note that all Mages and Warriors have had their talent points refunded. You will now start earning talent points at level 10.

Finally, for the duration of the beta, you will be able to find an NPC in each city that will allow you to reset your talent points and experiment with different talent paths. (Note: this option is ONLY available in the beta).

## Level Cap Raised

The level cap has been increased to 55. New zones, quests, items, and content have been added to accommodate the level increase.

## Item Stats Changed

Items have had a major overhaul. Armor values, damage, stats, and resists have been modified to reflect current play balance. Some items have also had their level requirements changed. Items that were subjected to this change and that were equipped on a character prior to the patch have been placed in the character's bag. If a character did not have space in its bags, please make room in that character's bags and re-login. Below are additional changes to items in general.

- Several axes, swords, and maces were changed from main hand only to either hand for dual-wielding purposes.
- [Horned Viking Helmet] has been updated with a new effect.
- [Cursed Eye of Paleth] has had its Shadow requirement removed.
- [Eye of Paleth] has had its Holy requirement removed.
- Witch Doctor Zum'rah should always drop something good now.
- First Mate's Hat[sic] can now drop off any pirate in Stranglethorn instead of just from Pretty Boy Duncan.

- [Deathblow] is no longer Warrior only.
- [Six Demon Bag] has been revamped.
- Look for new attributes on items with random properties.
- [Wolfshead Helm] changed to give AE silence instead of taunt.

## Sharing Quests

You can now share your quests with your entire party. In order to utilize this option, you need to open your quest log, select a quest, and press the "Share Quest" button. All members of your party will now be presented with the quest like you were the quest giver NPC. Some restrictions:

- You can only share with party members
- Party members must be nearby when you share
- Party members must meet the pre-requisites of the quest itself. For example, if you are on step 2 of a quest and your friend is still on step 1, you could not give him a "short-cut" to step 2.
- Quests generated from items cannot be shared.

## New Micro-Dungeon Designs

The Level Designers have gone in to the game and redesigned some of the Goldmine and Mushroom Cave Micro-Dungeons. Players can now find these redesigned Micro-Dungeons in both Alliance and Horde lands.

Goldmines in Hillsbrad Foothills, Mulgore, and Blasted Lands have been redesigned.

Mushroom Caves in Searing Gorge, Wetlands, Western Plaguelands, Felwood, Hinterlands, Swamp of Sorrows, Arathi Highlands, Ungoro Crater, Deadwind Pass, Stranglethorn, and Redridge have been redesigned.

Be sure to visit all of these areas to see exactly which Micro-Dungeons have been redesigned!
